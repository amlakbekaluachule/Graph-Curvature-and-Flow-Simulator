# GeoFlow

GeoFlow is a research-oriented codebase for discrete differential geometry on graphs.

It implements Ollivier–Ricci curvature, optimal transport, and Ricci flow from first principles, and uses curvature evolution to study geometric and topological behavior of discrete spaces.

The project is designed to mirror the mathematics closely, not to optimize for speed or visualization.

## What the code does

- Builds weighted undirected graphs
- Computes shortest-path metrics
- Constructs random walk probability measures
- Computes exact Wasserstein-1 distances
- Evaluates Ollivier–Ricci curvature on edges
- Evolves the graph via discrete Ricci flow
- Detects curvature singularities and instability
- Enforces mathematical invariants via validation
